                The University of Perpetual Help System DALTA (UPHSD) Molino Campus was
                established and inaugurated in May 1995. Currently,
                the UPHSD caters to a student population of 4,000 -
                a dramatic increase based on its initial 700 enrollees.
                Standing tall in a pristine land area of 6 hectares, the
                Molino campus is now the most notable educational
                institution in Bacoor, Cavite and its neighboring
                towns. It is currently undergoing campus expansion
                and upgrading of facilities.
                More than its structure, the people that comprise this thriving institution have continuously grown
                physically, intellectually, socially and spiritually as they consistently uphold the philosophy of the
                University: to constantly invoke Divine Guidance in the betterment of Filipino lives through quality
                education.

            <p class="perps-descrip">
                The school’s official name is University of Perpetual Help System DALTA (UPHSD).
                The seal was inspired by the special devotion of Dr. Josefina L. Tamayo, UPH co-founder and Tamayo grand matriarch, to the Blessed mother especially to the image of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, the school’s patroness. This well-known icon from the Byzantine era depicts the figure of Mary offering love and comfort to her son Jesus, even as the angelic beings above bear the instruments of His coming suffering and passion. Mary looks straight at the viewer, as if she wants to say that her perpetual help and comfort are also available to anyone who comes to her in need. The infant Jesus is symbolic of the youth who is nurtured by a devoted and loving Mary which speaks of the motherly care and love of the University.
                The two laurel leaves represent the two sons of the CEO and Chairman of the Board who are actively continuing the work that their parents have started in the community. The leaves also signify excellence which the university pursues not only in academics but also in leadership and in human relations for the fulfillment of the aspirations of the university as it carries on propagating its mission – to mold and educate youth as Helpers of God.
                The cameo is bordered by oval lines of maroon in white background. Maroon symbolizes the red blood of courage, vigor, and determination; white for purity; and the blue and gold colors of the Mother of Perpetual Help icon which symbolize generosity, abundance, hope, and vision.
                The year 1975 indicates when the University of Perpetual Help System DALTA was established while the tagline “Character Building is Nation Building”- UPHSD’s institutional motto expresses the encompassing commitment of Perpetual Help education to national development and progress.
